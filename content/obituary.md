## Full Obituary Text

Samuel Martin Hagood Sheeder was born on July 11, 1998, in Dallas, Texas. He passed away in Annapolis, Maryland on September 28, 2025, after a moped accident. We know he is in heaven because he accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Because of this, he was not afraid to leave this Earth.

God was at His creative best when He made Sam. Sam's presence lit up every room. He was handsome, full of adventure and wanderlust, and his brilliance shone in both mind and spirit. With his authentic and engaging nature, Sam could strike up a conversation with anyone, making them feel seen and heard. He was a natural debater (his parents don't know where he got that), able to dive into any topic with vigor. More often than not, he would win you over with his wit, charm, and perspective. He could rig up or fix anything. He was also stubborn, headstrong, and determined to do things his way. Those qualities may have been his greatest strength and biggest challenge.

Music was a thread that ran through Sam's life; whether he was playing or simply listening, it brought him immense joy. He was fearless and had a need for speed—running, zipping down streets on his bike or skateboard, skimming across water in a boat, or riding anything with a motor. Sam's zest for life was infectious, inspiring those around him to embrace every moment and chase after adventure with open hearts. His spirit reminds us all to live boldly, love deeply, and always seek out the next great experience. He loved connecting with nature. A couple of years ago, he drove from Florida to Georgia to help a friend and ended up in Annapolis months later – after he turned left and went to California and back, camping all along the way. Sam never went in straight lines, and he reminds us that the joy is in the journey.

Sam faced the hard and often lonely road of substance use disorder with courage and honesty. He confronted his struggles head-on and never shied away from the truth of his journey, even when the world's judgment made it harder to seek help or healing. To speak openly of addiction is rare; to do so with the generosity of spirit that Sam showed is extraordinary. Addiction does not discriminate. It touches families of every kind, and too often it brings isolation, misunderstanding, and pain. Yet Sam refused to let stigma define him, and we honor his openness and strength by sharing his story with the same candor.

What we have learned through Sam's fight is that hope is real and recovery is possible, but no one can do it alone. The path is full of setbacks and triumphs, moments of despair and rays of light. Reach out, speak up, and don't let shame silence you. Supporting a loved one through this journey is challenging and sometimes heartbreaking, but it is also an act of deep love and faith. We are not alone. Sam taught us the opposite of addiction is not sobriety; it is community. And "it's okay not to be okay."

We remain profoundly grateful for the vast web of support, encouragement, and compassion Sam received from friends, mentors, and community. In honor of Sam's memory, and in recognition of the countless families walking similar paths, we offer our experience, strength, and hope to anyone who needs it. If you are struggling, or if you are supporting someone who is, please know our hearts and hands are extended to you. It would be our privilege to listen, to share, and to walk alongside you. Lives truly hang in the balance, and together, we can help each other. Please, reach out to us if you need support. Our love and solidarity are yours, always.

We are deeply and forever grateful to Sam's sponsors, Allen and Tom, whose guidance and steadfast presence meant the world to him. Our heartfelt thanks also go out to his amazing sober support community in Annapolis, Dallas, Delray Beach, and beyond. We don't know all of you, but we feel your presence. These remarkable friends and mentors walked alongside Sam, offering steady encouragement, compassion, and hope. Their love and fellowship were a lifeline, helping him embrace each new day with courage and grace. The impact of their kindness and support will never be forgotten, and we will always cherish the profound difference they made in Sam's life and in ours.

Sam's circle of friends knew no boundaries. He moved with ease among people from all walks of life, from CEOs to those experiencing homelessness. His heart beat strongest in service to others, and he found his greatest joy in lifting up and advocating for those who needed it most. Sam's compassion knew no limits; he welcomed everyone as family, and his support network was as expansive as his generosity. So many people called Sam their brother, and he embraced each one with open arms.

Sam is survived by his father, Frank Sheeder and stepmother, Nancy Sheeder; mother, Julie Hagood; sister, Annie Hagood Sheeder; brother, Joey Vasto, brother, Rony Robinson, grandparents, Frank and Jan Sheeder; grandmother, Lois Oryl; aunts and uncles, Dave and Jennifer Hurley, Graham and Suzanne Hagood, and Mike and Ginger Jonason; cousins Brooke and Morgan Hurley, Jake and Gray Hagood, and Kara and Henry Jonason. His grandparents, Jim Hagood, Nancy Hagood, and Bob Oryl; his brother from another mother, Mark Narvaez; and his dear friend, Meg York, went to heaven before him.

We never doubted for a moment that Sam loved each of us with his whole heart. What brings us immense comfort is knowing that Sam was just as certain of our unconditional love for him—a love expressed not only in words every single time we were together or spoke, but in every embrace, every shared laugh, and every quiet moment together. That mutual, unwavering bond will live on in our hearts forever. Rest easy, our beautiful Sam.

Sam said if he ever left us, he'd want a party. "Don't take yourself too damn seriously." (AA Rule 62, Sam's favorite)
