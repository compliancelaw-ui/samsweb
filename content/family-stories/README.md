# Family Story Scripts & Prompts

This folder contains prompts, scripts, and drafts for each family member's story — both the written prose that will appear on the site and the video scripts for recording.

## The Goal

Each family member tells their story in their own voice. These stories will:
- Appear as prose on the `/families` page
- Be recorded as 2-3 minute videos embedded on the site
- Serve as the emotional backbone of Sam's OATH

## Guidelines for All Stories

**Tone:** Personal, honest, conversational. Not rehearsed, not clinical. Talk like you're telling a friend.

**Length (written):** 400-800 words each
**Length (video):** 2-3 minutes (roughly 300-450 words spoken)

**What to cover:**
1. Your relationship with Sam — a moment, a memory, something specific
2. How his substance use and mental health struggles affected YOU
3. The silence — what it felt like to carry it alone
4. The moment something shifted (or what you wish had been different)
5. Why you chose openness — what it means to you now
6. What you'd say to someone going through the same thing

**What to avoid:**
- Clinical language (say "struggled" not "suffered from substance use disorder")
- Blaming anyone — Sam, yourselves, the system
- Making it sound like a eulogy — this is about the LIVING experience of family
- Perfection — raw is better than polished

## Video Recording Tips

- Natural setting (home, outdoors, somewhere meaningful)
- Look at the camera like you're talking to one person
- It's OK to get emotional — that's the point
- No script reading — use bullet points, not a teleprompter
- Dress normally — authenticity over production value
- Good natural lighting, quiet room
- Phone camera is fine (horizontal/landscape mode)
- Record in one take if possible — imperfections are human
