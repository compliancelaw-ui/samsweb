# Annie's Story — A Sister's Perspective

## Writing Prompts

Use these to draft your written story and prepare for your video.

### About Sam
- What was Sam like as a brother? A specific memory that captures your relationship?
- The photos of Sam making you smile — what was happening in those moments?
- What did you and Sam share that was just between you two?

### Growing Up Alongside Struggle
- What was it like being Sam's sister while he was struggling?
- Did you feel like your own struggles were seen, or did they get overshadowed?
- How did you balance loving Sam with the confusion, frustration, or fear?
- Were there things you wanted to say but couldn't?

### The Silence
- Did your family talk about it openly at home? With friends? At school?
- What did you tell people when they asked about Sam?
- Did the silence feel like protection or like a weight?
- What did you carry alone that no one knew about?

### What You Wish People Understood
- What do people get wrong about being the sibling?
- What does it feel like when people only see the person struggling — and not the family around them?
- What would you say to a sister or brother going through this?

### Openness
- When did you decide to be open about your family's experience?
- What changed when you stopped being silent?
- What does Sam's OATH mean to you?
