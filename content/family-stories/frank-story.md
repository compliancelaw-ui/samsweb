# Frank's Story — A Father's Perspective

## Writing Prompts

Use these to draft your written story and prepare for your video. You don't have to answer every question — just the ones that feel right.

### About Sam
- What's a specific memory of Sam that captures who he was?
- What did people love about him?
- What's something about Sam that surprised people?

### The Struggle
- When did you first realize Sam was struggling?
- What did you do? What did you wish you'd done differently?
- How did it affect your day-to-day life — work, relationships, sleep?

### The Silence
- Why didn't you talk about it openly at first?
- What did the silence feel like? (guilt, shame, isolation, fear of judgment?)
- You had a good workplace with a strong culture — why did you still feel you couldn't share?
- What's the cost of that silence? For you personally? For your family?

### The Breaking Point
- What made you decide to write that LinkedIn post?
- What were you afraid of before posting it?
- What happened after? (300K+ views, messages, calls, "I thought I was the only one")
- What surprised you most about the response?

### The Movement
- Why did you start Sam's OATH?
- What's the difference between a support group and a movement?
- What do you want Sam's OATH to become?
- What would you say to a father/parent going through this right now?

### The Music
- Why did you write the songs?
- Which song means the most to you and why?
- How does music say what words alone can't?
