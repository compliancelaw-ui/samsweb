# Joey's Story — A Brother's Perspective

## Writing Prompts

Use these to draft your written story and prepare for your video.

### About Sam
- What was your relationship with Sam like? A specific memory?
- The photos of you two reading together, on ATVs, boating — what were those moments like?
- What did Sam teach you, or what did you learn from being his brother?

### Being the Brother
- How did Sam's struggles affect your own growing up?
- Did you understand what was happening when you were younger?
- Were there times you felt angry, confused, scared, or invisible?
- How did you process it — or did you just push it down?

### The Silence
- Did anyone talk to you directly about what Sam was going through?
- Did you feel like you could talk about it with friends?
- What did you carry that nobody asked about?

### Your Own Journey
- How has this experience shaped who you are?
- What do you wish someone had said to you during the hardest times?
- What does being open about it now feel like?

### For Other Brothers & Sisters
- What would you say to a younger brother or sister going through something similar?
- What do people not understand about being the sibling?
