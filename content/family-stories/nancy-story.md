Use these to draft your written story and prepare for your video.

### About Sam
- A memory of Sam that captures your relationship
- How did you and Sam build your bond? What did that look like?
- What did you see in Sam that others might have missed?

### A Stepmother's Experience
- What's it like loving a stepchild through substance use — a unique kind of weight?
- Did you ever wonder where you fit in the situation — whether your voice mattered?
- How did it affect your health, your sleep, your relationships?
- What do people not understand about being a stepparent in this situation?

### The Silence
- Why didn't you talk about it? Fear? Shame? Not wanting to overstep?
- What did the isolation feel like?
- Were there moments you almost reached out but didn't? What stopped you?
- What do you wish you'd known — that you weren't alone?

### Strength and Love
- How do you carry both the love and the loss?
- What does healing look like for you?
- What has being part of Sam's OATH meant for you?

### For Other Stepmothers & Family Members
